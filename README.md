c) Calculte the derivative predictors, like Geocoded social determinants of health (SVI), Charlson comorbidity index etc.

d) Conduct the Time to event analysis

e) Build the logistic model

f) Build the Linear regression model

The outcomes are presented into tables and graphs, and are reported in word documents.
